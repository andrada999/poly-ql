Term Frequency
==============

# Term frequency problem

`npm install gramophone`

## Write the term frequency problem in a programming language other than Python, without looking at the book. 

## My solution

This is a problem that surely has been fixed already.

## Check if your style corresponds to any of the styles in the book. If so discuss why. If not, discuss why it is different or which styles it combines. 

## Would you have programmed it differently now that you know about different styles? If so, why?
