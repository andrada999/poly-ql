Term Frequency
==============

Given a text file, output a list of the 25 most frequently-occurring non stop, 
words, ordered by decreasing frequency


## Language of choice

I have decided to write a solution for term frequency problem in javascript (using node JS). First I looked into `gramophone` and `natural` libraries. They provide decent NLP support, however "terms" in the libraries where defined using n-grams. Thus term frequencies would not be a single word. Another problem was multiple language support, which is lacking in most libraries and I only encountered later on.

## Style

I started using code similar to "code golf". Including a few libraries that almost got the solution in a couple of lines.

## Conclusion

Would you have programmed it differently now that you know about different styles? If so, why?
